## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Visualize the card component in desktop a mobile resolution properly

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project we learn how to use background images.

```css
    html{
      background-image: url(../assets/bg-pattern-top.svg), url(../assets/bg-pattern-top.svg);
      background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
      background-position-x: 120%, -150%;
      background-position-y: 300%, bottom;
      background-color: var(--BlueBG);
    }
    
    body {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }

```


### Continued development

We need to continue learning about how CSS works.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This helped me to understand how to use multiple backgrounds.
